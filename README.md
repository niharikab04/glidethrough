## Project description
In today's fast-paced world, individuals often face confusion and uncertainty due to a lack of clear guidance and reliable information. The overwhelming volume of unstructured and scattered information available online makes it challenging to find trustworthy advice. **Guide Through** addresses this problem by organizing content into different categories to share insights and experiences, facilitating community interaction and support. **Guide Through** aims to reduce the time users spend on decision-making and planning, enabling them to focus more on executing their tasks rather than wasting time figuring things out.

- **User Contributions**: post concise snippets in the "Advices" and "No-goes" sections or comprehensive guides in the "Blog" section.
- **Q&A Section**: Ask and answer questions to foster community interaction and support. Receive notifications for responses to the questions you asked.
- **Interactive Options**: Agree, disagree, like, share, and save posts.
- **Personalization**: Select interests to receive daily tips via email and in-app notifications.
- **Content Management**: Edit posts to ensure information remains up-to-date and relevant. Manage your profile: edit your interests, unsave saved content, and view, edit, and delete your posted content.
